# Automatic-Irrigation-System

## 🌱 Overview  
**Automatic-Irrigation-System** is a smart irrigation controller that automatically waters plants based on real-time soil moisture readings.  
The goal is to reduce manual effort and water wastage by turning the pump ON only when the soil becomes dry and turning it OFF after adequate moisture is restored.

The project also includes (or will include) a **manual override feature** that allows users to control the water pump manually.  
In the future, we plan to **fully separate the Automatic and Manual features** for better separation of concerns and cleaner architecture.
